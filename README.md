# RandomnessTestOfBinarySequence
Randomness Tests of Binary Sequence

Designed as the Chinese national standard GB/T 32915-2016 <Information security technology -- Randomness test methods for binary sequence>.

This project includes 15 randomness test for a 1,000,000-bit file:
  1. Monobit frequency test
  2. Frequency test within a block
  3. Poker test
  4. Serial test
  5. Runs test
  6. Runs distribution test
  7. Test for the longest run of ones in a block
  8. Binary derivative test
  9. Autocorrelation Test
  10. Binary matrix rank test
  11. Cumulative test
  12. Approximate entropy test
  13. Linear complexity test
  14. Maurer's "Universal test"
  15. Discrete fourier transform test

The initial project is programmed in MATLAB.
